# 19-bit Custom CPU

A custom-designed 19-bit CPU built using basic hardware modules including a Program Counter, Instruction Memory, Instruction Register, ALU, Control Unit, Reg file and Data Memory.

## 🧠 Overview

This project implements a custom CPU with a 19-bit wide architecture. The CPU is built from the ground up with modular components and is designed for instructional and experimental purposes. It supports basic instruction execution.

##  Architecture

The CPU follows a basic fetch-execute-writebl-memory cycle. It is designed with a focus on modularity and ease of understanding. All modules interact via a central control unit that decodes opcodes and manages control signals.

##  Modules

###  Program Counter (PC)
- Holds the address of the current instruction.
- Can increment sequentially or jump to a new address based on control signals.

###  Instruction Memory
- Stores the program instructions.
- Provides the current instruction to the Instruction Register based on the PC.

###  Instruction Register
- Latches the fetched instruction for decoding and execution.

###  ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
- Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
- Supports operations like ADD, SUB, AND, OR, NOT, etc.

###  Control Unit
- Decodes the opcode of the instruction.
- Generates control signals for each module.

###  Data Memory
- Handles load and store operations for reading/writing data.

##  Instruction Format

The instruction is 19 bits wide and typically divided as: [4:O]opcode, [3:0] rs1, rs2, rd, [13:0] addr_imm (address for immediate field), [5:0] branch offset
